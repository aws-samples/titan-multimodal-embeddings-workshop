## Titan Multimodal Embedding Workshop

#### Welcome to the Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings workshop!

The goal of this workshop is to give you hands-on experience leveraging Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings through Amazon Bedrock. Here is a quick definition for both elements:

- **Amazon Bedrock** is a fully managed service that provides access to FMs from third-party providers and Amazon; available via an API. With Bedrock, you can choose from a variety of models to find the one that’s best suited for your use case.

- **Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings** is a multimodal embeddings model for use cases like searching images by text, image, or a combination of text and image. Designed for high accuracy and fast responses, this model is an ideal choice for search and recommendations use cases.
